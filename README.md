# CS50x Miami
![CS50x Miami Puzzle Day](https://i.imgur.com/1nrPm7c.jpg)

## Introduction
[CS50x Miami](http://theideacenter.co/cs50xmiami) is [The Idea Center](http://www.theideacenter.co) @ [Miami Dade College's](http://www.mdc.edu) adaption of [CS50](https://www.cs50.net), [Harvard University's](http://www.harvard.edu) introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science, and the art of programming, for MDC students and the South Florida community.

But what does that mean?

Well, CS50x Miami is a course that teaches you how to design and implement solutions to problems. But more than that, it teaches you how to think more critically, more methodically, and more computationally, if you will.

In fact, computer science itself isn't really about computers (or programming for that matter), it's really about information. How do you think about it? How do you represent it? And with what methods or algorithms can you process it?

So, we'll first learn how to program with [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), a graphical programming language via which we'll explore some fundamental programming constructs, by dragging and dropping puzzle pieces.

We'll then quickly transition to a more traditional text-based language called [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_programming_language), that's actually been around quite a while. And as such, it doesn't come with that many features out of the box, so to speak. So anything you want the computer to do, you're going to have to teach it to do yourself; from the simplest of algorithms, to the most sophisticated.

The problems we'll solve in this course are inspired by real-world domains: cryptography, finance, forensics, gaming, and more.

Over the course of CS50x Miami, you'll be part of a global community solving those same problems, surrounded by classmates, by Dylan, by Gregory, and so many others on CS50x Miami's team.

But the most successful outcome ahead is to do something, ultimately, that we've not taught you. Indeed, what ultimately matters in this course is not so much where you end up relatively to your classmates, but where you end up relative to yourself when you began.

And when you do end up there, will you be able to say proudly, just like I can, "I took CS50".

Let's get started.

### <a name="sections"></a>Sections
Lectures are supplemented by weekly, 120-minute sections led by the teaching fellows. Sections provide you with opportunities to explore the course’s material in a more intimate environment, with only your teaching fellow and a handful of classmates present, as well as to dive into hands-on activities.

Although you can attend multiple sections if your personal schedule allows, you are required to attend the same section you signed up for during selection at minimum.

A schedule of sections and instructors, subject to change, appears below.

#### Grading
Problem sets are graded on three axes. They, along with some pertinent questions to consider, appear below:

- Correctness: “To what extent is your code consistent with our specifications and free of bugs?”
- Style: “To what extent is your code readable (i.e., commented and intended with variables aptly named?”
	- Can I easily tell (via braces/indentation) the boundaries of each block of code?
	- Is it clear what this variable does, based on its name? (:joy::poop::triumph:)
	- If I didn’t understand C code, would I be able to tell what is happening based on comments alone?
	- Are there so few or so many comments that I am distracted by their presence or absence?
- Design: “To what extent is your code written well (i.e., clearly, efficiently, elegantly, and/or logically)?”
	- Can I eliminate:
		- Repetition
		- Loops
		- [Magic numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)#Unnamed_numerical_constants)
	- Is there a “shorter” way to accomplish the same thing?
	- Should this code have been broken out into its own function?

### <a name="quizzes"></a>Quizzes
The course has two 90-minute quizzes. These quizzes are "closed-book," but you may utilize during each quiz one two-sided page (8.5" × 11") of handwritten or typed notes, blank scrap paper, and a pen or pencil, nothing else.

When final grades are computed, your scores on these two quizzes are weighted equally.

Unless arranged with the course’s heads in advance, quizzes cannot ordinarily be taken at alternative times even if missed by accident, except in cases of medical emergency.

A schedule of quizzes appears below.

|  Number | Date          |
|---------|---------------|
| Quiz #1 | TBA, 6-8:00pm |
| Quiz #2 | TBA, 6-8:00pm |

### <a name="finalproject"></a>Final Project
The climax of this course is its final project. The final project is your opportunity to take your newfound savvy with programming out for a spin and develop your very own piece of software. So long as your project draws upon this course’s lessons, the nature of your project is entirely up to you, albeit subject to the staff’s approval. You may implement your project in any language(s) as long as the staff approves. You are welcome to utilize any infrastructure, provided the staff ultimately has access to any hardware and software that your project requires. All that we ask is that you build something of interest to you, that you solve an actual problem, that you impact campus, or that you change the world. Strive to create something that outlives this course.

Inasmuch as software development is rarely a one-person effort, you are allowed an opportunity to collaborate with one or two classmates for this final project. Needless to say, it is expected that every student in any such group contribute equally to the design and implementation of that group’s project. Moreover, it is expected that the scope of a two- or three-person group’s project be, respectively, twice or thrice that of a typical one-person project. A one-person project, mind you, should entail more time and effort than is required by each of the course’s problem sets. Although no more than three students may design and implement a given project, you are welcome to solicit advice from others, so long as you respect the course’s policy on academic honesty.

Extensions on the final project are not ordinarily granted, except in cases of emergency. Lateness of submissions is determined down to the minute by submissions' timestamps. Submitting more than seven minutes late is equivalent to not submitting at all.

| Milestone      | Date |
|----------------|------|
| Proposal       | TBA  |
| Status Report  | TBA  |
| Hackathon      | TBA  |
| Implementation | TBA  |

## <a name="events"></a>Events

### <a name="puzzleday"></a>Puzzle Day
The first Saturday of the class is our Puzzle Day, open to CS50x Miami students (and friends). Solve non-programming related logic questions. Teams of 2, 3, or 4 encouraged but not required. Every member of your team should register anytime before Friday, TBA. Invite friends to register as well!

We will have pizza, candy, soda, music, a DJ, and a photobooth!

### <a name="hackathon"></a>Hackathon
On Saturday, TBA, is the Hackathon, an epic hacking session during which you can dive into your final project’s implementation alongside classmates and staff. If you choose to partake, you’ll be asked to propose three milestones for yourself that evening:

- a "good" one that you intend to achieve no matter what;
- a "better" one that you think you can achieve; 
- and a "best" one that you hope to achieve.

Also in attendance are candy, soda, and pizza (noticing a trend yet?).

### <a name="projectfair"></a>Project Fair
From 6pm until 8pm on TBA is the Fair, an epic display of final projects. Not only is the CS50x Miami Fair a venue at which to see classmates' projects and demo your own, it is an opportunity to mingle with students, family, faculty, and staff from across campus as well as recruiters from industry. Attendance is expected of all students.

## <a name="academichonesty"></a>Academic Honesty
This course’s philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as "be reasonable." The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course’s material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.

The essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own. Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you. Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your code to others, but you may not view theirs, so long as you and they respect this policy’s other constraints. Collaboration on the course’s test and quiz is not permitted at all. Collaboration on the course’s final project is permitted to the extent prescribed by its specification.

Below are rules of thumb that (inexhaustively) characterize acts that the course considers reasonable and not reasonable. If in doubt as to whether some act is reasonable, do not commit it until you solicit and receive approval in writing from the course’s heads. Acts considered not reasonable by the course are handled harshly. If the course refers some matter for disciplinary action and the outcome is punitive, the course reserves the right to impose local sanctions on top of that outcome that may include an unsatisfactory or failing grade for work submitted or for the course itself. The course ordinarily recommends exclusion (i.e., required withdrawal) from the course itself.

If you commit some act that is not reasonable but bring it to the attention of the course’s heads within 72 hours, the course may impose local sanctions that may include an unsatisfactory or failing grade for work submitted, but the course will not refer the matter for further disciplinary action except in cases of repeated acts.

### <a name="reasonable"></a>Reasonable

- Communicating with classmates about problem sets' problems in English (or some other spoken language).
- Discussing the course’s material with others in order to understand it better.
- Helping a classmate identify a bug in his or her code at office hours, elsewhere, or even online, as by viewing, compiling, or running his or her code, even on your own computer.
- Incorporating a few lines of code that you find online or elsewhere into your own code, provided that those lines are not themselves solutions to assigned problems and that you cite the lines' origins.
- Reviewing past semesters' quizzes and solutions thereto.
- Sending or showing code that you’ve written to someone, possibly a classmate, so that he or she might help you identify and fix a bug.
- Sharing a few lines of your own code online so that others might help you identify and fix a bug.
- Turning to the course’s heads for help or receiving help from the course’s heads during the quiz or test.
- Turning to the web or elsewhere for instruction beyond the course’s own, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not for outright solutions to problem set’s problems or your own final project.
- Whiteboarding solutions to problem sets with others using diagrams or pseudocode but not actual code.
- Working with (and even paying) a tutor to help you with the course, provided the tutor does not do your work for you.

### <a name="notreasonable"></a>Not Reasonable

- Accessing a solution to some problem prior to (re-)submitting your own.
- Asking a classmate to see his or her solution to a problem set’s problem before (re-)submitting your own.
- Decompiling, deobfuscating, or disassembling the staff’s solutions to problem sets.
- Failing to cite (as with comments) the origins of code or techniques that you discover outside of the course’s own lessons and integrate into your own work, even while respecting this policy’s other constraints.
- Giving or showing to a classmate a solution to a problem set’s problem when it is he or she, and not you, who is struggling to solve it.
- Looking at another individual’s work during the test or quiz.
- Paying or offering to pay an individual for work that you may submit as (part of) your own.
- Providing or making available solutions to problem sets to individuals who might take this course in the future.
- Searching for or soliciting outright solutions to problem sets online or elsewhere.
- Splitting a problem set’s workload with another individual and combining your work.
- Submitting (after possibly modifying) the work of another individual beyond the few lines allowed herein.
- Submitting the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to another.
- Submitting work to this course that you intend to use outside of the course (e.g., for a job) without prior approval from the course’s heads.
- Turning to humans (besides the course’s heads) for help or receiving help from humans (besides the course’s heads) during the quiz or test.
- Viewing another’s solution to a problem set’s problem and basing your own solution on it.
